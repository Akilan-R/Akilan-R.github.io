Hello, I’m Akilan, an integrated master’s student at IISER Pune, India. While my coursework is primarily in biology, I’ve also explored mathematics, physics, and 
data science. I particularly enjoy modeling-based approaches to tackle complex questions in a broad variety of domains. I'm currently intrigued by game theory, with 
applications in economics as well as social sciences. 

I am currently pursuing my master’s thesis at the Centre for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn, Germany under the guidance of Prof. Wolfram Barfuss. 
Our research investigates how social information can modulate long-term cooperation in the context of climate action. We approach this problem using a framework of game theory multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Previously, I have worked on various projects in theoretical ecology and evolutionary biology. In the summer of 2024, I interned in Prof. Hanna Kokko’s lab, 
where I studied the eco-evolutionary dynamics of interspecific mating. Beyond the basic sciences, I am interested in questions in economics, 
philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science.

I also volunteer for social causes, and am currently working as a volunteer for a suicide prevention helpline. In my free time, I enjoy reading non-fiction, playing football or a game of chess
